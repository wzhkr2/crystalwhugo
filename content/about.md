I graduated from UNCC with a computer science degree and now I’m seeking a master’s degree in data science and business analytics.I plan to complete my degree in college and my plans after graduation include pursuing a career as a business analyst for your company. In my free time, I like hiking to enjoy nature and relax myself.
